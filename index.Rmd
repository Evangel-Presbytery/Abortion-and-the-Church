title: "Abortion and the Church"
author: "Evangel Presbytery"
date: "2022"
description: "In this work, the men of Evangel Presbytery expose the horrors of abortion, and then proceed to lay out the many arguments which exist against the practice of abortion. The concluding chapter explains the biblical foundation of what it looks like for (1) civil authorities, (2) church authorities, and (3) individuals to act and speak faithfully regarding the slaughter of the unborn. In the end, abortion will continue until the church embraces God's beautiful blessing of fruitfulness, especially in His giving of woman to be the giver of life."
